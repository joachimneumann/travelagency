## Strategy (what the page must achieve)

1. **Reduce booking risk fast with proof, not claims**
   Western travelers compare multiple agencies quickly. Show license details, real contact info, clear inclusions and exclusions, and response-time promises above the fold.

2. **Sell structured customization, not fixed packages**
   Top competitors win with clear product architecture. Present sample routes plus adjustable modules (hotel tier, transport, guiding level, experience density).

3. **Target value-conscious premium travelers ($500+/week)**
   Avoid lowest-price messaging. Use transparent "from" anchors with what is included and how comfort changes by tier.

4. **Optimize for mobile conversion**
   Keep CTA visible, keep forms short, and make route cards easy to scan on a phone.

5. **Lead with consultation CTA**
   Primary conversion goal is a free discovery call. Every major section should naturally guide users to that CTA.
