## Strategy (what the page must achieve)

1. **Reduce “Vietnam uncertainty” fast with trust + transparency**
   The market is fragmented and buyers worry about quality/copycats, so your landing page should **publish license info, consistent contact details, and very clear inclusions/exclusions**.  

2. **Sell “custom” while using modular building blocks**
   Most agencies deliver customization via repeatable modules (drivers, hotels, guides, fees, signature experiences). You should present your offers as **“inspiration journeys + travel styles + quick tailoring”** (the way Wide Eyed Tours & Travel does).  

3. **Design for mobile conversion (thumb-friendly)**
   Mobile is a major share of bookings, so include a **sticky mobile CTA** and keep forms short. 

4. **Anchor value without racing to the bottom on price**
   Use “starting from” anchors and compare by **privacy level, hotel category, transport mode, and activity density** (that’s how pricing actually varies).

## Section: “How it works” (4 steps, conversion-focused)

### H2: How planning with Van travels works

1. **Discovery call** — we learn your style, pace, and budget
2. **We design 1–2 route options** — clear inclusions + upgrade choices
3. **You choose + we refine** — hotels, experiences, comfort level
4. **You travel supported** — local help, quick fixes, smooth logistics

> Why this matters: online discovery + fast quotation is increasingly the norm, so simplify the path from “curious” to “talk to a human.” 

---

## Section: Choose your travel style (card grid)

### H2: Pick a vibe — we’ll tailor everything around it

Cards (6 max):

* Food & Culture
* Nature & Adventure
* Beach & Slow Travel
* Family-Friendly Comfort
* Honeymoon & Romance
* Premium & Luxury

Each card includes:

* 1 sentence promise
* 3 example experiences (bullets)

> Tie-in to market reality: “signature experiences” are the easiest way to differentiate beyond transport+hotels.  

---

## Section: Sample journeys (inspiration, not “fixed packages”)

### H2: Sample journeys (fully customizable)

Intro line: “Use these as starting points — we adjust route, hotels, and pace.”

Create 3–6 journey cards total, split like:

* **Vietnam** (2–3 examples)
* **Vietnam + Cambodia** (1–2 examples)
* **Vietnam + Thailand** (1–2 examples)

**Journey card template**

* Title: “Vietnam Essentials — 10–12 days”
* Best for: first timers / couples / families / food lovers
* Route line: Hanoi → … → Ho Chi Minh City (example)
* 3 highlights
* “Typical inclusions” (icons/bullets): private driver, select guided days, vetted hotels, key tickets
* CTA: **Book a free discovery call to tailor this**

**Optional price anchoring (if you want)**

* “Private multi-day tours often ladder by hotel grade + transport + activity density.” 
* If you show starting prices, keep it as “from” and show what it includes (price transparency is a conversion lever).

## Section: Why Van travels (your differentiation block)

### H2: Why travelers book with Van travels

### H2: What’s included (typical)

* Private transport + airport transfers

---

## Section: Destination confidence (reduce planning friction)

### H2: Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia — how to choose

Split into 3 mini-blocks:

* **Vietnam:** best for culture + food + varied landscapes
* **Thailand:** best for beaches + comfort travel infrastructure

Add a mini “Best time to go” note per destination (1–2 lines each).

## FAQ (SEO + objections)

### H2: Frequently asked questions

Use 8–12 FAQs. Prioritize:

* “Is $500/week enough for a comfortable trip?”

* “How fast do you deliver an itinerary?”
* “What happens if weather disrupts plans?” 
* “Do you help with visas / entry?”
* “How do payments work?”
* “Can we combine Vietnam + Thailand + Cambodia smoothly?”

> Implement as accordion on mobile (short scanning, less overwhelm).
