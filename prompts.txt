structure
=========
You are a marketing and web design expert with over 13 years of experience. I need you to create a landing page structure for my business - a travel agency in Vietnam.
Travel locations: Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos
Target audience: western tourist with a budget above 500 USD per week. 

Analyze the report (research.pdf) and the content of the file sea_travel_agency_market_report_2026-02-22.txt to get a better understanding on the topic and provide the most effective strategy and landing page structure.

Goal: create effective structure that would motivate potential clients to book a holiday with us. Call to action: book a free discovery call.

Use the already existing content of structure.md and improve on it.

Output: markdown (MD) landing page structure, responsive, SEO optimized. 
Change the name of the company to "Chapter 2" and the name of the web page to chapter2.live
Tone of voice: friendly, human, no robotic


Code
====
Use the provided Web page structure in structure.md to create an effective static landing page for my business -
a travel agency in Vietnam.
The Web page should have a menu that allows customers to either select their destination country or to select a travel style. The web page should be responsive and mobile friendly. Use light theme with bright accent colors. Design should have professional, minimal, clean layout.
The output should be structured in easy to understand folders and the content should be ready for editing by a beginner level HTTP / CSS / Javascript programmer.
