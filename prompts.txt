structure
=========
You are a marketing and web design expert with over 13 years of experience. I need you to create a landing page structure for my business - a travel agency in Vietnam.
Travel locations: Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos
Target audience: western tourist with a budget above 500 USD per week. 

Analyze the report (research.pdf) and the content of the file sea_travel_agency_market_report_2026-02-22.txt to get a better understanding on the topic and provide the most effective strategy and landing page structure.

Goal: create effective structure that would motivate potential clients to book a holiday with us. Call to action: book a free discovery call.

Use the already existing content of structure.md and improve on it.

Output: markdown (MD) landing page structure, responsive, SEO optimized. 
Change the name of the company to "Chapter 2" and the name of the web page to chapter2.live
Tone of voice: friendly, human, no robotic


Code
====
Use the provided Web page structure in structure.md to create an effective static landing page for my business -
a travel agency in Vietnam.
The Web page should have a menu that allows customers to either select their destination country or to select a travel style. The web page should be responsive and mobile friendly. Use light theme with bright accent colors. Design should have professional, minimal, clean layout.
The output should be structured in easy to understand folders and the content should be ready for editing by a beginner level HTTP / CSS / Javascript programmer.

Code 2
======
You are building a static, responsive landing page for my business: a Vietnam-based travel agency. Use the exact layout conventions and required sections from structure.md as the baseline and keep the project framework-free (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; no build step).

1) Business goals (priority order)
	1.	Maximize qualified leads (inquiries/booking requests).
	2.	Let users quickly browse tours by Destination Country or Travel Style.
	3.	Establish trust (reviews, credentials, local expertise).

2) Core UX: menu + filtering (required)

Create a top navigation with two primary entry points:
	•	Destinations (by country)
	•	Travel Styles (e.g., Adventure, Culture, Beach, Family, Luxury, Budget, Food)

Behavior requirements:
	•	Clicking a destination/style filters tour cards on the same page (no reload).
	•	Support combined filters (Destination + Style) plus:
	•	“All destinations”, “All styles”
	•	“Clear filters”
	•	On mobile: menu collapses into an accessible hamburger (keyboard + ARIA).
	•	The filter state should be reflected in the URL (query params like ?dest=Japan&style=Culture) so pages can be shared.

3) Required sections (must follow structure.md)

Implement all required sections from structure.md, tailored to a Vietnam travel agency:
	•	Hero with headline, subheadline, primary CTA, secondary CTA
	•	Featured tours (card grid rendered from JSON)
	•	“Why us / local expertise”
	•	Trust section (reviews, badges, metrics)
	•	FAQ (5–8 Qs)
	•	Contact / lead capture section
	•	Footer with business details + social links placeholders

4) Data-driven tours (beginner editable)

Tours must be stored in data/trips.json and rendered dynamically via JS. Include fields:
	•	id, title, shortDescription
	•	destinationCountry
	•	styles (array)
	•	durationDays
	•	priceFrom (optional)
	•	image (local path)
	•	highlights (array)
	•	seasonality (optional)
	•	rating (optional)
Render cards with: image, title, destination, style tags, duration, price (if present), and a “Plan this trip” CTA button.

5) Conversion-focused lead form flow (required)

Create a high-conversion lead capture experience:

Flow
	•	Primary CTA in hero opens a modal (or scrolls) to a lead form.
	•	Form is multi-step (2–3 steps) with a progress indicator:
	1.	Trip basics (destination, style, dates or month, number of travelers, budget range)
	2.	Contact (name, email, WhatsApp/phone, preferred language)
	3.	Notes (optional) + consent checkbox
	•	Show microcopy that reduces friction (e.g., “Response within 24 hours”).
	•	Add lightweight validation and clear error states.
	•	On submit: show a success state with next steps (e.g., “We’ll contact you on WhatsApp/email.”)

Technical handling
	•	Since static site: implement submit options:
	•	Default: mailto: fallback that opens an email prefilled with form content
	•	Also provide a clearly commented placeholder for integrating Formspree/Netlify Forms later (do not require it to run)
	•	Store the last selected filters (destination/style) and prefill the form accordingly.

Trust + persuasion near the form
	•	Place 3–6 trust bullets next to the form (local experts, transparent pricing, curated partners, etc.)
	•	Add 2–3 short testimonial cards (placeholder but realistic).

6) SEO requirements (strict)

Implement on index.html:

Meta + social
	•	Unique, keyword-relevant <title> (<= 60 chars)
	•	Meta description (<= 155 chars)
	•	Canonical tag
	•	OpenGraph tags: og:title, og:description, og:type, og:url, og:image
	•	Twitter Card tags: twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image
	•	Favicons (placeholder files) + web manifest placeholder

Structured data (required)
Add JSON-LD schema.org markup for:
	•	TravelAgency with:
	•	name, url, logo, image, description
	•	address (placeholder but structured)
	•	areaServed (Vietnam + destinations)
	•	contactPoint (WhatsApp/phone/email placeholders)
	•	sameAs (social links placeholders)
	•	openingHoursSpecification (optional)
	•	Also include a minimal WebSite schema with SearchAction if feasible.

On-page SEO
	•	One clear H1
	•	Logical heading structure (H2/H3)
	•	Descriptive alt text for images
	•	Internal anchor links (nav items link to sections)
	•	Fast performance: compress images, defer JS, minimal CSS

7) Images (make it immediately appealing)

You MUST include attractive, relevant photos for:
	•	Hero background/hero image
	•	6–12 tour cards
	•	1–2 supporting section images (optional)

Instructions
	•	Download images from the web and store them locally in /assets/img/.
	•	It is acceptable if images are copyrighted for this prototype.
	•	Prefer high-quality travel photography matching the destinations and Vietnam themes.
	•	Optimize images (resize + compress) for web. Use .webp when possible and include sensible dimensions (e.g., hero ~2000px wide, cards ~900–1200px wide).
	•	Name files clearly (e.g., hero-hoian.webp, tour-japan-culture.webp).
	•	Provide a simple assets/img/credits.md listing each image filename and its source URL.

8) Design system constraints
	•	Light theme, clean/minimal, bright accent colors used sparingly
	•	Consistent spacing + typography scale
	•	Buttons: clear primary/secondary styles + hover/focus states
	•	Mobile-first responsive layout (320px+)
	•	Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA for modal/menu, keyboard navigation, focus outlines, contrast

9) Technical constraints
	•	Static only: HTML/CSS/JS (no React/Vue, no build tools)
	•	No heavy libraries; if you use anything external, justify it and keep it minimal
	•	Code must be beginner-editable with comments where edits are expected

10) Output format (project + documentation)

Deliver a complete project with this folder structure (or better):
	•	/index.html
	•	/assets/css/styles.css
	•	/assets/js/main.js
	•	/assets/img/* (downloaded + optimized images)
	•	/assets/img/credits.md (image sources)
	•	/data/trips.json
	•	/README.md explaining:
	•	how to edit text, colors, and destinations/styles
	•	how to add a new trip in JSON
	•	how filter URLs work
	•	how to run locally (simple static server)
	•	how to connect a real form backend later

11) Deliverables

Provide the full contents of all files. The site must work by opening index.html locally (or via a simple static server), with filtering + modal form functioning.
