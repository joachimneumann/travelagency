# Travel Agencies in Vietnam: Market Demand and Offer Landscape

This report evaluates market demand drivers for travel agencies and tour operators in Vietnam, maps the competitive landscape, and benchmarks how agencies package and price offers (with a close read of wideeyedtours.com and comparable operators).

Findings are based on official and semi-official statistics and policy sources, plus public offer pages from major agencies and DMCs.

## Market Demand Essentials

International (inbound) demand has become the dominant growth lever for inbound agencies since the country fully reopened. Vietnam recorded about 17.6 million international visitor arrivals in 2024, then about 21.2 million in 2025 (a new all-time high), exceeding the pre-pandemic peak of 18 million in 2019.

For agencies, this expands the pipeline for:
- Multi-day circuit tours
- Day tours and transfers sold as add-ons
- Higher-value specialist themes such as premium cruises, private guides, and curated culinary itineraries

Inbound demand is also structurally shaped by source-market composition and entry-mode flexibility. In the first five months of 2025 alone, Vietnam received 9.2+ million international visitors, with China and South Korea leading by volume; about 85% arrived by air. This tends to concentrate demand into airport-linked hub itineraries (North-Central-South circuits) and increases the value of strong ground-handling capacity and supplier contracting in major entry hubs.

Domestic travel remains a separate, high-volume demand engine that produces predictable peaks, especially around Tet. During the 2025 Lunar New Year holiday window (Jan 25-Feb 2, 2025), Vietnam recorded an estimated 12.5 million domestic tourists, up 19% year-on-year; several provinces and cities reported tourism revenues exceeding VND 1 trillion during that period.

For agencies, domestic peaks reward "fast bundlers" that can assemble transport + hotel + attraction tickets + guide services at promotional prices and distribute them through high-frequency digital channels.

Outbound demand (Vietnamese citizens traveling abroad) also matters because it underpins the business models of large retail agencies and MICE-oriented agencies. Official-data summaries indicate about 6.7 million Vietnamese traveled abroad in 2025 (up 26.4% year-on-year). This supports flight-inclusive packages, visa support services, and group-departure offerings, often sold through mixed online/offline networks.

A final demand signal comes from digital channels. The Vietnam country brief of the e-Conomy SEA 2025 program (Google, Temasek, and Bain & Company) shows online travel GMV at about US$4B in 2025, with a projection of about US$8B by 2030. For agencies, this indicates that itinerary discovery, quotation, and booking will keep moving online, raising the importance of conversion design, chat-based customer support, and trust signals.

## Policy and Operating Environment

Visa and border-access policy has been an unusually material demand driver for Vietnam. In 2023, Vietnam expanded e-visa validity to up to 90 days, with single or multiple entry options, and extended unilateral visa-exempt temporary stay for certain nationalities to 45 days.

These changes make longer itineraries easier to sell (and reduce itinerary engineering constraints for agencies), especially for travelers combining multiple regions or adding cross-border add-ons.

In December 2025, the Viet Nam Government Portal reported that the Government supplemented 41 additional border gates for e-visa use, raising the total to 83 eligible ports under Resolution 389/NQ-CP. This supports demand for cruise-linked itineraries, overland loops, and regional multi-entry travel plans.

On the demand-stimulation side, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism launched a Tourism Development Stimulus Program for 2025 ("Vietnam - Timeless Journey, Endless Love"), encouraging integrated promotional packages and noting discounts of up to 50% across services depending on provider conditions.

For agencies, the regulatory environment is also defined by licensing and deposit rules. During pandemic relief, deposits were reduced; official legal summaries indicate the reductions ran until Dec 31, 2023, after which deposit levels reverted to baseline under Decree 168/2017 (for example, inbound international travel services VND 250m, outbound VND 500m, domestic VND 100m).

A related operational point is that certain state fees can change over time. One practitioner summary cites Circular 64/2025/TT-BTC as temporarily reducing international tour operation licensing fees for a defined period (July 2025-Dec 2026).

## Market Structure and Competitive Landscape

Vietnam's travel agency market is structurally fragmented. In 2019, Vietnam's official tourism annual report noted 2,667 inbound/outbound tour operators and highlighted rapid growth in travel enterprises, with licensing activity exceeding 1,000 dossiers in that year. Fragmentation and licensing churn are stable market features.

By late 2025, a foreign-investor briefing compiling VNAT data reported 4,437 international tour operators and 44,171 active tour guide cards (language distribution heavily weighted to English and Chinese). While this is a secondary compilation rather than a primary VNAT bulletin, it aligns with the direction in earlier official reporting.

The VNAT stimulus portal reinforces this by publishing a long list of registered tour operators (addresses, contact details, license numbers), illustrating both the depth of licensed supply and how official programs can steer demand toward registered operators.

In practical terms, the market clusters into a few archetypes:
- **Large integrated retail groups (domestic + outbound heavy):** built around scale advantages (call centers, offline branches, flight-ticket distribution, charter relationships, MICE). Example: Vietravel, with claims of 800,000+ customers annually, affiliated Vietravel Airlines, and an airport counter at Tan Son Nhat International Airport.
- **Premium inbound specialists and DMCs:** sell either directly to foreign travelers (B2C) or to overseas travel sellers (B2B), emphasizing service consistency, guide standards, risk management, and responsible travel. Example: Discova.
- **Local legacy and budget-focused operators:** dominate day tours, open-bus style transport, and attraction-heavy itineraries; compete on price, volume, and distribution density.

## Market Demand and Offers in Practice

The offer landscape is best understood as modular packaging. Across agency types, Vietnam products are commonly built from repeatable modules: transfers, accommodation, guides, entrance fees, and signature experiences (cooking, cycling, street food, cruises, motorbike loops). This modularity enables customization while reusing proven supplier blocks.

A clear example is Wide Eyed Tours & Travel, which markets customizable itineraries and categorizes tours by interests (adventure, beach, culture, cycling, eco, food, golf, wellness) and by holiday types (day tours, family, group, luxury, honeymoon, cruise). Its public catalog includes transparent pricing and "top seller" tags, supporting both inspiration browsing and conversion.

At the large integrated end, agencies often offer broader service menus beyond tours. Vietravel's DMC-facing site, for example, lists categories such as day trips, package tours/combos, visa services, transport, tour guides, and ticket/show products.

For corporate and MICE demand, large operators emphasize planning and execution capabilities. Saigontourist Travel describes its core business as leisure tour design and operation plus meeting, incentive, and business travel services, and cites a cooperation network of 400+ travel companies and agents internationally.

In inbound leisure and B2B ground handling, premium DMC positioning is common. Threeland Travel describes itself as a premium DMC with local multilingual teams serving 1,800+ global partners and offering private tours, group tours, MICE, and themed products.

## Pricing and Value Propositions

Pricing in Vietnam's agency market is strongly driven by:
- Private vs group delivery
- Hotel grade
- Internal transport mode (train/flight/road)
- Activity density (cruise grade, specialized guides, premium attractions)

On wideeyedtours.com, listed examples include:
- 10-day private "Best of Vietnam" itinerary at US$1,514 per person sharing
- 14-day private tour at US$1,744 per person sharing
- 18-day private tour at US$2,319 per person sharing
- 2-day Ha Long Bay cruise from US$217 per person sharing

A typical family-oriented private package page communicates value through explicit inclusions: hotel classes and nights, meal count, named activities, guides and tickets, and "all transport," while excluding insurance and visas (offered as extras).

Local-volume operators often publish in VND and compete on low headline prices for half-day/day tours. For example, thesinhtourist.vn lists half-day city tours and Cu Chi tunnel tours around VND 299,000, and multi-day domestic packages in the multi-million VND range.

Digital distribution data also helps contextualize pricing pressure. Mordor Intelligence estimates Vietnam's online travel market at US$2.87B in 2025, projecting growth to US$4.69B by 2031, and reports mobile as a major share of bookings (72.77% in 2025).

## Distribution Channels and How Offers Reach Buyers

Vietnam's agency distribution is structurally mixed: traditional retail and partnerships remain important, but the center of gravity keeps shifting toward digital discovery and mobile conversion.

Inbound-focused agencies frequently rely on B2B distribution through overseas travel sellers, wholesalers, and DMC networks. The formation of Discova (merging Buffalo Tours and Olympus Tours) illustrates this B2B logic at regional scale.

Domestic and outbound retail agencies often use omnichannel distribution: websites/apps for discovery and payment, plus hotlines and offline touchpoints for complex bookings. Vietravel's emphasis on a 24/7 support center and airport counter aligns with this hybrid trust model.

Official programs also shape distribution. The VNAT 2025 stimulus portal promotes discounted packages and lists registered tour operators, helping steer demand toward participating and registered businesses.

## Risks, Trust, and Due Diligence in a Fragmented Market

High fragmentation increases both competition and consumer risk. Two recurring issues in public traveler discussions are:
1. Inconsistent service quality across the long tail of operators
2. Brand confusion and copycats, where historic names are reused by unrelated sellers

As a result, trust signals have become more valuable. Common trust elements include published tour-operator license numbers, consistent contact/office information, clear inclusion/exclusion lists, insurance expectations, and credible external reviews.

Operational risk also influences offers. Vietnam's storm season and localized flooding risk can disrupt itineraries, pushing agencies toward flexibility, alternative routing, and real-time communication.

## Offer Outlook and Strategic Implications

The demand outlook is structurally positive for the next planning cycle, but not uniformly profitable. International arrivals are above pre-pandemic levels, domestic demand remains strong, and outbound travel is expanding. At the same time, growing supply (licensed operators, OTAs, and experience platforms) increases price competition, especially in standardized routes and day tours.

Agencies best positioned to defend margins are likely to do one or more of the following:
- Differentiate with clearly packaged experiences (not just transport + hotels), transparent inclusions, and consistent operations
- Lean into B2B DMC capability (service standards, guide systems, sustainability integration, multi-destination reliability)
- Build omnichannel trust infrastructure (24/7 support, strong pre-trip information, physical touchpoints)
- Exploit policy windows and official programs to create time-bound, high-conversion bundles while maintaining compliance and traceability

Vietnam wraps up 2025 with 21.2 million foreign arrivals.
